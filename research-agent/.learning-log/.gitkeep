# Learning Log Directory

This directory stores personal learnings extracted from research sessions to build a searchable knowledge base over time.

## Structure

- `YYYY-MM/` - Learnings organized by month
- `index.json` - Master index of all learnings
- `tags.json` - Tag organization and counts

Each learning is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter containing:
- Key insights from research
- How to apply the learning
- Related learnings
- Questions to explore
- Application status

## Privacy

By default, this directory is tracked in git for personal use. To make it private:

1. Add to `.gitignore`: `research-agent/.learning-log/`
2. Each user maintains their own local learning log

See `scripts/learning-manager.py` for managing learnings and `assets/learning-log-guide.md` for complete documentation.
