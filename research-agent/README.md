### Validation Workflow

**Recommended workflow** for validating research outputs:

1. **During Research**: Keep validation criteria in mind while investigating
2. **After Research**: Run comprehensive validation:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/validate-all.sh my-research.md . 75
   ```
3. **Review Results**: Address any failures or warnings
4. **Iterate**: Improve research based on feedback
5. **Final Check**: Re-validate before sharing

### Quality Thresholds

Recommended completeness thresholds by use case:
- **Internal exploration**: 50% (basic completeness)
- **Team documentation**: 70% (good quality)
- **External sharing**: 85% (excellent quality)
- **Publication/training**: 90%+ (comprehensive)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Understanding Unfamiliar Code
```
User: How does authentication work in this Next.js app?

Claude: [investigating-codebases skill auto-activates]
I'll investigate the authentication system in this Next.js application.

[Searches for auth-related files, reads implementations, traces flows]

Authentication Analysis:

The app uses JWT-based authentication with the following components:

1. **Login Flow** (src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:15-88)
   - Validates credentials against database
   - Generates JWT token (src/lib/jwt.ts:42)
   - Sets HttpOnly cookie for security

2. **Auth Middleware** (src/middleware.ts:25-67)
   - Validates JWT on protected routes
   - Refreshes tokens if needed
   - Redirects to login if invalid

3. **Client Auth Context** (src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:10-120)
   - Manages client-side auth state
   - Provides login/logout functions
   - Handles token refresh

Security measures:
- HttpOnly cookies prevent XSS
- CSRF tokens on mutations
- Token expiration: 15 minutes
- Refresh token: 7 days

### Example 2: Best Practice Lookup
```
User: /best-practice React Server Components in Next.js 15

Claude: [researching-best-practices skill provides guidance]

Best Practices: React Server Components (Next.js 15, 2025)

Core Principles:
1. Server Components by default
2. Use 'use client' only when needed
3. Compose Server and Client Components properly

[Detailed guide with code examples, do's/don'ts, checklist...]
```

### Example 3: Technology Comparison
```
User: /compare Prisma vs Drizzle for our PostgreSQL project

Claude: [Provides comprehensive comparison]

Comparison: Prisma vs Drizzle

Quick Summary:
- Prisma: Best for rapid development, migrations, type safety
- Drizzle: Best for performance, SQL control, lightweight

[Detailed comparison matrix, code examples, recommendations...]
```

### Example 4: Pattern Analysis
```
User: What design patterns are used in the codebase?

Claude: [analyzing-patterns skill auto-activates]
I'll analyze the codebase for design patterns.

[Searches for pattern indicators, examines implementations]

Design Patterns Found:

1. **Factory Pattern** (src/factories/userFactory.ts:10-35)
   - Creates user objects with different roles
   - Clean separation of construction logic

2. **Observer Pattern** (src/events/eventEmitter.ts:15-88)
   - Event-driven communication between components
   - Pub/sub for UI updates

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Command

- **`/research`**: Broad questions, multiple sources, comprehensive analysis
- **`/investigate`**: Specific code/feature, detailed execution tracing
- **`/best-practice`**: Quick lookup of current standards
- **`/compare`**: Decision-making between options

### Getting Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "research authentication", try "research JWT authentication in Next.js with security best practices"
2. **Provide Context**: Mention your tech stack, constraints, or goals
3. **Combine Commands**: Use `/investigate` first, then `/best-practice` to compare
4. **Ask Follow-ups**: Research is iterative—ask for clarification or deeper dives
