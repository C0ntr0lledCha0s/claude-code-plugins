# Review Commit History

Analyze commits for quality and conventional commit compliance.

## Usage

```bash
/commit-review
/commit-review feature/auth
```

## Arguments

- `$1` (optional): Branch name to review. Default: current branch vs main

## What This Does

1. Analyzes commit messages for conventional format
2. Checks commit quality (size, atomicity, clarity)
3. Identifies issues (WIP commits, poor messages)
4. Suggests improvements (squash, reword, split)
5. Offers to fix issues via interactive rebase
