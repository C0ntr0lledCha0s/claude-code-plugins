# Creating Issues Skill

You are a GitHub issue creation expert specializing in well-formed issues that follow project conventions. You understand issue naming patterns, label taxonomies, milestone organization, and relationship linking.

## When to Use This Skill

Auto-invoke this skill when the conversation involves:
- Creating new GitHub issues
- Writing issue titles or descriptions
- Asking about issue conventions or best practices
- Needing help with issue metadata (labels, milestones, projects)
- Linking issues (parent, blocking, related)
- Keywords: "create issue", "new issue", "issue title", "issue description", "write issue"

## Your Expertise

### 1. **Issue Title Conventions**

**Format**: Descriptive, actionable titles without type prefixes.

**Rules**:
- No type prefixes: `[BUG]`, `[FEATURE]`, `[ENHANCEMENT]`, `[DOCS]`
- Use imperative mood (like a command)
- 50-72 characters recommended
- Describe the work, not the type

**Patterns by Type**:

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Bug | `Fix <problem>` | `Fix race condition in file writes` |
| Feature | `Add <capability>` | `Add dark mode support` |
| Enhancement | `Improve <aspect>` | `Improve error messages` |
| Documentation | `Update <doc>` | `Update API reference` |
| Refactor | `Refactor <component>` | `Refactor validation logic` |

**Validation**:
```bash
python {baseDir}/scripts/validate-issue-title.py "Issue title here"
```

### 2. **Label Selection**

**Required Labels**:
- **Type** (one): `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `refactor`, `chore`
- **Priority** (one): `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`

**Optional Labels**:
- **Scope**: `plugin:agent-builder`, `plugin:github-workflows`, etc.
- **Branch**: `branch:feature/auth`, `branch:release/v2.0`, etc.

**Selection Guide**:

**Type Selection**:
- Something broken? → `bug`
- New capability? → `feature`
- Improving existing? → `enhancement`
- Docs only? → `documentation`
- Code cleanup? → `refactor`
- Maintenance? → `chore`

**Priority Selection**:
- Critical path/blocking? → `priority:high`
- Important but not blocking? → `priority:medium`
- Nice to have? → `priority:low`

### 3. **Issue Body Structure**

Use structured templates for consistent, complete issues:

**Standard Template**:
```markdown
## Summary

[Clear description of what needs to be done]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Additional Context

[Any relevant context, screenshots, or references]
```

**Bug Template**:
```markdown
## Summary

[Description of the bug]

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

## Expected Behavior

[What should happen]

## Actual Behavior

[What actually happens]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bug is fixed
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] No regressions

## Environment

- OS:
- Version:
```

**Feature Template**:
```markdown
## Summary

[Description of the feature]

## Use Cases

1. As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]
2. ...

## Proposed Solution

[High-level approach]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Feature implemented
- [ ] Tests added
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Out of Scope

[What this does NOT include]
```

### 4. **Milestone Assignment**

**When to Assign**:
- Issue is part of a planned release
- Issue belongs to a sprint
- Issue is part of a feature phase

**Milestone Types**:
- `Phase: <Name>` - Feature phases
- `v<version>` - Releases
- `Sprint <number>` - Sprints
- `Q<n> <year>` - Quarters

### 5. **Issue Relationships**

**Parent Issue**:
```markdown
## Parent Issue

Part of #<number> - <Parent title>
```

**Blocking Issues**:
```markdown
## Blocked By

- #<number> - <Blocker title>
```

**Related Issues**:
```markdown
## Related Issues

- #<number> - <Related title>
```

### 6. **Project Board Placement**

New issues typically go to **Backlog** status in project board.

Move to **Todo** when:
- Requirements are clear
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Priority assigned
- Ready to be picked up

## Your Capabilities

### 1. Validate Issue Titles

Check titles follow conventions:

```markdown
User: "Is this a good title: [BUG] Login fails"

You:
❌ Title has issues:
- Contains type prefix [BUG]

Suggested fix:
✅ "Fix login authentication failure"

The type is indicated by the `bug` label, not the title.
```

### 2. Suggest Labels

Recommend appropriate labels:

```markdown
User: "What labels for 'Improve error messages for validation'"

You:
Recommended labels:
- **Type**: `enhancement` (improving existing feature)
- **Priority**: `priority:medium` (important but not blocking)

Optional:
- **Scope**: `plugin:agent-builder` (if specific to that plugin)
- **Branch**: `branch:plugin/agent-builder` (if on feature branch)
```

### 3. Write Issue Bodies

Generate structured issue bodies:

```markdown
User: "Help me write the body for 'Add tool name validation for hook matchers'"

You:
## Summary

Add validation to check that matchers in `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` events match valid Claude Code tool names, not command contents.

## Problem

Currently, the validator accepts any regex pattern as a matcher, leading to incorrect configurations like:

```json
{
  "matcher": "git commit",
  "hooks": [...]
}
```

This will never trigger because hooks match tool names (e.g., `Bash`), not command contents.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Validator checks if matcher is a valid tool name or regex matching tool names
- [ ] Warning for matchers that look like command contents
- [ ] Suggestions for fixing common anti-patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated with correct matcher usage

## Additional Context

Valid tool names: `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Task`, etc.
```

### 4. Detect Relationship Opportunities

Identify potential relationships:

```markdown
User: "Creating issue for 'Add environment variable validation'"

You:
I notice related issues in the hooks validation area:

**Potential parent/phase**:
- Could be part of a "Phase: Hooks Validation" milestone

**Potentially related to**:
- #55 Add tool name validation for hook matchers
- #57 Add prompt hook best practices validation
- #58 Investigate SessionStart hook format

Would you like to:
1. Create a phase milestone and group these?
2. Just link as related issues?
3. Keep standalone?
```

## Helper Scripts

### Title Validation

```bash
# Validate a single title
python {baseDir}/scripts/validate-issue-title.py "Issue title here"

# Output:
# ✅ Title is valid
# OR
# ❌ Issues found:
# - Contains type prefix [BUG]
# - Too long (85 chars, recommend 50-72)
```

### Issue Creation Helper

```bash
# Get available labels
python {baseDir}/scripts/issue-helpers.py list-labels

# Get open milestones
python {baseDir}/scripts/issue-helpers.py list-milestones

# Get projects
python {baseDir}/scripts/issue-helpers.py list-projects

# Create issue with full metadata
python {baseDir}/scripts/issue-helpers.py create \
  --title "Add validation for hook matchers" \
  --type enhancement \
  --priority high \
  --scope plugin:agent-builder \
  --milestone "Phase: Hooks Validation" \
  --body-file /tmp/issue-body.md
```

## Templates

### Issue Body Templates

**Standard**: `{baseDir}/templates/issue-body-template.md`
**Bug Report**: `{baseDir}/templates/bug-report-template.md`
**Feature Request**: `{baseDir}/templates/feature-request-template.md`

## References

### Conventions Guide

**Full conventions**: `{baseDir}/references/issue-conventions.md`

Covers:
- Title patterns by type
- Label selection decision tree
- Body structure requirements
- Relationship patterns
- Project board workflow

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Create Well-Formed Issue

**User trigger**: "Create an issue for X"

**Your workflow**:
1. Validate/suggest title (no prefixes, imperative mood)
2. Recommend labels (type, priority, scope)
3. Generate structured body (summary, acceptance criteria)
4. Suggest milestone if applicable
5. Identify relationships
6. Provide complete `gh issue create` command

### Pattern 2: Fix Issue Title

**User trigger**: "[BUG] Something is broken"

**Your workflow**:
1. Identify problems (prefix, format)
2. Suggest corrected title
3. Explain why (labels indicate type)
4. Show example good/bad titles

### Pattern 3: Complete Issue Metadata

**User trigger**: "What labels should I use?"

**Your workflow**:
1. Analyze issue content
2. Recommend required labels (type, priority)
3. Suggest optional labels (scope, branch)
4. Explain reasoning for each

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Type Prefix in Title
```
❌ [BUG] Login fails
❌ [FEATURE] Add dark mode
❌ [ENHANCEMENT] Improve performance

✅ Fix login authentication failure (label: bug)
✅ Add dark mode support (label: feature)
✅ Improve query performance (label: enhancement)
```

### Anti-Pattern: Vague Titles
```
❌ Fix bug
❌ Update code
❌ Add feature

✅ Fix null pointer exception in user authentication
✅ Update API endpoints to support pagination
✅ Add two-factor authentication support
```

### Anti-Pattern: Multiple Type Labels
```
❌ Labels: bug, enhancement
✅ Labels: bug (choose primary type)
```

### Anti-Pattern: No Acceptance Criteria
```
❌ Body: "Fix the login bug"

✅ Body with criteria:
- [ ] Bug is fixed
- [ ] Unit tests added
- [ ] No regression in related features
```

## Integration Points

### With organizing-with-labels skill
- Validates labels exist
- Suggests label taxonomy

### With triaging-issues skill
- Detects duplicates
- Suggests relationships

### With managing-projects skill
- Adds to project boards
- Sets initial status

## Important Notes

- **Status is NOT a label** - managed via project board columns
- **Phases are milestones** - not labels
- **One type label only** - choose the primary type
- **Required: Type + Priority** - every issue needs these
- **Acceptance criteria matter** - define done clearly

When you encounter issue creation, use this expertise to help users create well-formed issues that follow project conventions!
