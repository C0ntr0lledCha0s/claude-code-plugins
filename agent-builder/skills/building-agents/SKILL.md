# Building Agents Skill

You are an expert at creating Claude Code agents (subagents). Agents are specialized assistants that handle delegated tasks with independent context and dedicated resources.

## When to Create an Agent vs Other Components

**Use an AGENT when:**
- The task requires specialized, focused expertise
- You need independent context and isolation from the main conversation
- The task involves heavy computation or long-running operations
- You want explicit invocation rather than automatic activation
- The task benefits from dedicated tool permissions

**Use a SKILL instead when:**
- You want automatic, context-aware assistance
- The expertise should be "always on" and auto-invoked
- You need progressive disclosure of context

**Use a COMMAND instead when:**
- The user explicitly triggers a specific workflow
- You need parameterized inputs via command arguments

## Agent Schema & Structure

### File Location
- **Project-level**: `.claude/agents/agent-name.md`
- **User-level**: `~/.claude/agents/agent-name.md`
- **Plugin-level**: `plugin-dir/agents/agent-name.md`

### File Format
Single Markdown file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown body.

### Required Fields
```yaml
---
name: agent-name           # Unique identifier (lowercase-hyphens, max 64 chars)
description: Brief description of what the agent does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)
---
```

### Optional Fields
```yaml
---
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash    # Comma-separated list (omit to inherit all tools)
model: sonnet                     # sonnet, opus, haiku, or inherit
---
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only**
- **No underscores or special characters**
- **Max 64 characters**
- **Action-oriented**: `code-reviewer`, `test-runner`, `api-designer`
- **Descriptive**: Name should indicate the agent's purpose

## Agent Body Content

The Markdown body should include:

1. **Role Definition**: Clear statement of the agent's identity and purpose
2. **Capabilities**: What the agent can do
3. **Workflow**: Step-by-step process the agent follows
4. **Best Practices**: Guidelines and standards the agent should follow
5. **Examples**: Concrete examples of expected behavior

### Template Structure

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: One-line description of agent purpose and when to invoke it
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: sonnet
---

# Agent Name

You are a [role description] with expertise in [domain]. Your role is to [primary purpose].

## Your Capabilities

1. **Capability 1**: Description
2. **Capability 2**: Description
3. **Capability 3**: Description

## Your Workflow

When invoked, follow these steps:

1. **Step 1**: Action and rationale
2. **Step 2**: Action and rationale
3. **Step 3**: Action and rationale

## Best Practices & Guidelines

- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
- Guideline 3

## Examples

### Example 1: [Scenario]
[Expected behavior and approach]

### Example 2: [Scenario]
[Expected behavior and approach]

## Important Reminders

- Reminder 1
- Reminder 2
- Reminder 3
```

## Tool Selection Strategy

### Minimal Permissions (Recommended Start)
```yaml
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
```
Use for: Research, analysis, read-only operations

### File Modification
```yaml
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob
```
Use for: Code generation, file editing, refactoring

### System Operations
```yaml
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash
```
Use for: Testing, building, git operations, system commands

### Web Access
```yaml
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch
```
Use for: Documentation lookup, external data fetching

### Full Access
```yaml
# Omit the tools field entirely
```
Use with caution: Agent inherits all available tools

## Model Selection

- **haiku**: Fast, simple tasks (searches, summaries, quick analysis)
- **sonnet**: Default for most tasks (balanced performance and cost)
- **opus**: Complex reasoning, critical decisions, heavy analysis
- **inherit**: Use the model from the parent context (default if omitted)

## Creating an Agent

### Step 1: Gather Requirements
Ask the user:
1. What is the agent's primary purpose?
2. What tasks should it perform?
3. What tools does it need?
4. Should it have specialized knowledge or constraints?

### Step 2: Design the Agent
- Choose a clear, descriptive name (lowercase-hyphens)
- Write a concise description (focus on WHEN to use)
- Select minimal necessary tools
- Choose appropriate model
- Structure the prompt for clarity

### Step 3: Write the Agent File
- Use proper YAML frontmatter syntax
- Include clear role definition
- Document capabilities and workflow
- Provide examples and guidelines
- Add important reminders

### Step 4: Validate the Agent
- Check naming convention (lowercase-hyphens, max 64 chars)
- Verify required fields (name, description)
- Validate YAML syntax
- Review tool permissions for security
- Ensure description is clear and actionable

### Step 5: Test the Agent
- Place in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Test invocation via Task tool
- Verify behavior matches expectations
- Iterate based on results

## Generator Scripts

## Security Considerations

When creating agents, always:

1. **Minimize Tool Permissions**: Only grant necessary tools
2. **Validate Inputs**: Check for command injection, path traversal
3. **Avoid Secrets**: Never hardcode API keys or credentials
4. **Restrict Scope**: Keep agents focused on specific tasks
5. **Review Commands**: Carefully audit any Bash operations

## Maintaining and Updating Agents

Agents aren't "set and forget" - they need regular maintenance and updates to stay effective.

### When to Update an Agent

Update agents when:
- **Requirements change**: New features or different scope
- **Performance issues**: Too slow, too expensive, not accurate enough
- **Security concerns**: New vulnerabilities or permission needs
- **Best practices evolve**: New patterns become standard

Enhancement Analysis: code-reviewer
Overall Score: 8.5/10

Detailed Scores:
  Schema Compliance:  10/10
  Security:           9/10
  Content Quality:    8/10
  Maintainability:    7/10

Recommendations:
1. 🟢 MEDIUM: Add more examples (currently 1, recommend 3+)
2. 🟢 LOW: Improve section headings for better navigation
```

### Common Update Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Reduce Tool Permissions
**Problem**: Agent has Bash but doesn't need it
**Solution**:
```bash
/agent-builder:agents:update my-agent
> What to update? 2 (tools)
> Select preset: 1 (Read, Grep, Glob)
✅ Tools updated, security improved
```

#### Scenario 2: Improve Performance/Cost
**Problem**: Agent uses opus but could use sonnet
**Solution**:
```bash
/agent-builder:agents:update my-agent
> What to update? 3 (model)
> Select model: 2 (sonnet)
✅ 3x faster, 5x cheaper, still capable
```

#### Scenario 3: Add Missing Documentation
**Problem**: Agent lacks examples and error handling
**Solution**:
```bash
/agent-builder:agents:enhance my-agent
# Reviews findings
/agent-builder:agents:update my-agent
# Manually add examples section
# Manually add error handling section
```

#### Scenario 4: Fix Security Issues
**Problem**: Agent has Bash without input validation
**Solution**:
```bash
/agent-builder:agents:enhance my-agent
# Identifies security issue
/agent-builder:agents:update my-agent
# Either: remove Bash, or add validation docs
```

### Migration and Modernization

As best practices evolve, older agents may need modernization:

**Signs an agent needs modernization:**
- Created before current guidelines
- Uses outdated patterns
- Lower enhancement score (<7/10)
- Missing key sections (examples, error handling)
- Over-permissioned tools

**Modernization checklist:**
- [ ] Update to current schema (check required fields)
- [ ] Apply security best practices
- [ ] Add missing sections (workflow, examples, error handling)
- [ ] Optimize tool permissions (minimal necessary)
- [ ] Optimize model selection (cost/performance)
- [ ] Improve description clarity (when to invoke)
- [ ] Add concrete examples (2-3 scenarios)
- [ ] Document edge cases

**Automated modernization:**
```bash
/agent-builder:agents:enhance my-agent
# Review suggestions
/agent-builder:agents:update my-agent
# Apply recommended changes
```

### Version Control Best Practices

When updating agents in version control:

**Before making changes:**
```bash
git add .claude/agents/my-agent.md
git commit -m "backup: agent before major update"
```

**After changes:**
```bash
python3 enhance-agent.py my-agent  # Verify improvement
git add .claude/agents/my-agent.md
git commit -m "refactor(agent): improve my-agent security and docs

- Reduced tool permissions (removed Bash)
- Added input validation documentation
- Added 3 concrete examples
- Improved error handling section

Enhanced score: 6.5/10 → 8.5/10"
```

**Track improvements over time:**
```bash
# Before
python3 enhance-agent.py my-agent > before.txt

# Make changes
/agent-builder:agents:update my-agent

# After
python3 enhance-agent.py my-agent > after.txt

# Compare
diff before.txt after.txt
```

### Integration with Other Tools

The maintenance commands and scripts integrate with:
- **validation scripts**: Ensure schema compliance
- **building-agents skill**: Provides best practices knowledge
- **git hooks**: Can run validations automatically
