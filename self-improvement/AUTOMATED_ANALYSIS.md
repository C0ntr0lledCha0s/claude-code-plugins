```

## Hook Configuration

The plugin includes two hooks:

### 1. Stop Hook (End of Conversation)

**Trigger**: When conversation ends
**Script**: `analyze-conversation.sh`
**Purpose**: Analyze conversation and track patterns

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/analyze-conversation.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. SessionStart Hook (New Conversation)

**Trigger**: When new session begins
**Script**: `load-learnings.sh`
**Purpose**: Load patterns and learnings into context

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/load-learnings.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

### analysis.log

Plain text log of all analysis runs:
```
[2025-01-20T16:30:00] === Starting conversation analysis for session 1234567890 ===
[2025-01-20T16:30:00] Statistics: 15 total turns, 8 user, 7 assistant, 523 lines
[2025-01-20T16:30:00] Keywords: bugs=3, security=2, quality=5, help_requests=2
[2025-01-20T16:30:00] Code Quality: 4 code blocks, tests=0, validation=1, error_handling=2
[2025-01-20T16:30:00] PATTERN DETECTED: [important] missing_tests: Code provided but no tests mentioned
...
```

## Viewing Tracked Data

Use the provided commands to view accumulated data:

### View Patterns

```bash
/show-patterns
```

Shows all tracked patterns with:
- Pattern type and description
- Severity (critical/important/minor)
- Occurrence count
- First and last seen timestamps

### View Learnings

```bash
/show-learnings
```

Shows all learning points with:
- Learning key and text
- When first learned
- Reinforcement count
- Last reinforcement timestamp

### View Metrics

```bash
/show-metrics
```

Shows conversation statistics:
- Total sessions analyzed
- Average/median conversation length
- Recent session history
- Trend analysis

## Context Loading

At the start of each new session, the SessionStart hook loads important context:

```
🔄 Self-Improvement Context Loaded

⚠️ Critical patterns to watch:
  • high_error_rate: Multiple errors encountered in conversation (seen 5x)

📋 Important patterns to remember:
  • missing_tests: Code provided but no tests mentioned (seen 12x)
  • missing_validation: Code provided but no input validation mentioned (seen 8x)

💡 Recent learning points:
  • SQL injection topic came up - ensure parameterized queries used
  • Input validation missing - add validation before business logic
  • Tests not provided with code - always include test examples

Apply these learnings proactively in this session to avoid repeating past issues.
```

This context helps Claude:
- **Avoid recurring mistakes** before they happen
- **Proactively apply learnings** without being reminded
- **Focus on known weaknesses** in advance
- **Improve first-time quality** based on past patterns

## Pattern Elimination Workflow

The goal is to eliminate patterns through learning:

```
1. Pattern Detected: "missing_tests" (count: 1)
   └─> Conversation had code but no tests

2. Pattern Reinforced: "missing_tests" (count: 5)
   └─> Still forgetting to include tests

3. Learning Applied: Tests now included proactively
   └─> Pattern stops being triggered

4. Pattern Eliminated: Count stays at 5, no new occurrences
   └─> Success! Behavior improved.
```

**Measuring Success:**
- **Bad**: Pattern count keeps increasing
- **Good**: Pattern count stops growing
- **Excellent**: New patterns don't get created

## Management Scripts

### View All Data

```bash
# View patterns
bash ~/.claude/plugins/self-improvement/hooks/scripts/view-patterns.sh

# View learnings
bash ~/.claude/plugins/self-improvement/hooks/scripts/view-learnings.sh

# View metrics
bash ~/.claude/plugins/self-improvement/hooks/scripts/view-metrics.sh
```

### Reset Data

To clear all tracked data (use with caution):

```bash
bash ~/.claude/plugins/self-improvement/hooks/scripts/reset-data.sh
```

This will:
- Backup existing data
- Clear patterns, learnings, and metrics
- Reset to fresh state
- Keep backups in `~/.claude/self-improvement/backups/`

## Privacy & Data

**What's tracked:**
- Conversation statistics (turns, lines)
- Keyword occurrences (counts only)
- Pattern detections
- Learning reinforcements

**What's NOT tracked:**
- Actual conversation content
- User information
- Code snippets
- Specific details

**All data is stored locally** in your home directory: `~/.claude/self-improvement/`

## Customization

### Adjust Thresholds

Edit `analyze-conversation.sh` to customize:

```bash
# Current thresholds
local bug_count_threshold=5    # Trigger high_bug_discussion
local security_count_threshold=3  # Trigger security_focus
local error_threshold=3          # Trigger high_error_rate
local sentiment_threshold=-3     # Trigger negative_user_experience
local confusion_threshold=5      # Trigger unclear_communication
```

### Add Custom Patterns

Add your own pattern detection:

```bash
analyze_custom_pattern() {
    local file="$1"

    # Count your custom keywords
    local custom_count=$(grep -ci "your-keyword" "${file}" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

    if [[ ${custom_count} -gt THRESHOLD ]]; then
        track_pattern "custom_pattern" "Your description" "severity"
    fi
}
```

### Add Custom Learnings

Add custom learning triggers:

```bash
if [[ ${custom_topic} -gt 0 ]]; then
    track_learning "custom_learning" "Your learning point text"
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks Not Running

**Check hook installation:**
```bash
# Verify hooks.json exists
ls ~/.claude/plugins/self-improvement/hooks/hooks.json

# Verify scripts are executable
ls -l ~/.claude/plugins/self-improvement/hooks/scripts/
```

**Check Claude Code hook support:**
- Ensure your Claude Code version supports hooks
- Check `.claude/settings.json` for hook configuration

### No Data Being Tracked

**Check log file:**
```bash
tail -n 50 ~/.claude/self-improvement/analysis.log
```

**Common issues:**
- Transcript file not found (path may vary)
- Python3 not installed
- Permissions issue with ~/.claude directory

### Data Files Corrupted

**Reset and start fresh:**
```bash
bash ~/.claude/plugins/self-improvement/hooks/scripts/reset-data.sh
```

## Benefits of Automated Analysis

### Passive Learning
- No user action required
- Runs automatically in background
- Builds knowledge base over time

### Pattern Recognition
- Identifies recurring issues automatically
- Quantifies how often mistakes happen
- Tracks improvement (or regression)

### Proactive Improvement
- Context loaded at session start
- Claude knows what to avoid
- First-time quality improves

### Objective Measurement
- Concrete metrics (not just feelings)
- Trend analysis over time
- Evidence-based improvement

### Continuous Feedback Loop
```
Conversation → Analysis → Pattern Detection → Learning →
Context Loading → Better Conversation → Repeat
```

## Example: Pattern Elimination

**Week 1:**
```
Pattern: missing_tests
Count: 8 occurrences
Status: Recurring problem
```

**Week 2:**
```
Context loaded: "Tests not provided with code - always include test examples"
Claude includes tests proactively in 6/7 conversations
Pattern: missing_tests
Count: 9 occurrences (+1, down from +8/week)
Status: Improving!
```

**Week 3:**
```
Context reinforced: Tests are now automatic
Claude includes tests in all conversations
Pattern: missing_tests
Count: 9 occurrences (+0)
Status: Eliminated! 🎉
```

## Advanced: Integration with Manual Review

Combine automated analysis with manual review:

```bash
# End of conversation:
1. Automated analysis runs (Stop hook)
2. Patterns/learnings tracked automatically

# Start of next session:
1. Context loaded automatically (SessionStart hook)
2. Manual review if needed: /review-my-work
3. See both automated patterns and manual critique
```

**Best of both worlds:**
- **Automated**: Catches patterns across conversations
- **Manual**: Deep dive into specific conversation quality
- **Combined**: Comprehensive continuous improvement

## Future Enhancements

Potential future features:
- ML-based pattern detection
- Automatic suggestion generation from patterns
- Integration with code review tools
- Trend visualization dashboard
- Export reports for teams
- Pattern sharing across users (opt-in)

## Anthropic Best Practices Compliance

This plugin and the broader claude-code-plugins architecture have been analyzed against [Anthropic's official guidance on building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents). Here's the comprehensive assessment:

### Core Principles Alignment

#### 1. Simplicity ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Anthropic guidance:** "Start simple and add complexity only when it improves outcomes"

**Our implementation:**
- Agents are single Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- No complex frameworks or unnecessary abstraction layers
- Tool permissions start minimal and expand only as needed
- Clear separation: Agents vs Skills vs Commands vs Hooks

**Example from self-critic agent:**
```yaml
---
name: self-critic
description: "Expert critic providing honest feedback"
tools: Read, Grep, Glob  # Minimal permissions
model: sonnet
---
```

#### 2. Transparency ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Anthropic guidance:** "Explicitly show the agent's planning steps"

**Our implementation:**
- Structured workflow sections in all agent definitions
- Meta-cognitive questioning built into prompts
- TodoWrite tool for visible task tracking
- Clear output format specifications
- This analysis system provides transparent feedback loops

**Example from self-critic workflow:**
```markdown
## Your Workflow
1. Context Gathering: Review conversation history
2. Output Analysis: Examine responses in detail
3. Quality Assessment: Rate on key dimensions
4. Issue Identification: Categorize problems
5. Constructive Feedback: Provide actionable suggestions
```

#### 3. Tool Documentation (ACI Focus) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Anthropic guidance:** "Carefully craft agent-computer interfaces through thorough tool documentation"

**Our implementation:**
- Explicit tool lists in frontmatter
- Validation enforces recognized tool names
- Clear permission boundaries per agent
- Progressive privilege model (least privilege principle)

### Workflow Pattern Alignment

#### Orchestrator-Workers Pattern ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Anthropic guidance:** "Central LLM dynamically breaks tasks and delegates to workers"

**Our implementation:**
```
User completes work
→ /review-my-work command (orchestrator)
→ Invokes self-critic agent (worker)
→ Agent analyzes and provides feedback
→ Results aggregated back to user
```

The meta-architect agent acts as orchestrator, delegating to specialized agents.

#### Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Anthropic guidance:** "One LLM generates while another provides iterative feedback"

**Our implementation:**
- Primary Claude instance generates responses
- Self-critic agent evaluates quality across 6 dimensions
- Learnings stored and loaded in future sessions
- Creates continuous improvement loop

### Areas Where We Excel Beyond Anthropic's Guide

#### 1. Meta-Programming Architecture 🌟
We go beyond standard patterns by implementing **agents that build agents**:
- Meta-architect agent designs other agents
- Building-agents skill provides generator scripts
- Self-improving system that extends its own capabilities

This is next-level agent architecture not covered in Anthropic's guide.

#### 2. Cross-Session Learning 🌟
Persistent learning across conversations:
```bash
Session N: Work + Analysis → Store learnings
Session N+1: Load learnings → Apply to new work
```

Creates continuously improving agent system beyond single-session scope.

#### 3. Event-Driven Context Management 🌟
Hooks provide intelligent context injection:
- SessionStart: Load relevant learnings
- Stop: Analyze and store patterns
- Automated pattern detection and learning reinforcement

### Areas for Enhancement

Based on Anthropic's recommendations, we've identified improvement opportunities:

#### 1. Testing & Validation ⭐⭐⭐⚙️⚙️
**Anthropic guidance:** "Test extensively with multiple example inputs"

**Current state:**
- ✅ Schema validation via validate-agent.py
- ✅ Naming convention enforcement
- ❌ No automated test suite for agent behavior
- ❌ No example input/output test cases

**Recommendation:** Add behavioral testing:
```python
# Future: test-agent.py
# Test agent with sample scenarios
# Verify output format compliance
# Check common failure modes
```

#### 2. Performance Monitoring ⭐⭐⚙️⚙️⚙️
**Anthropic guidance:** "Measure performance continuously and iterate"

**Current state:**
- ✅ Session metrics captured
- ✅ Pattern tracking
- ❌ No per-agent performance metrics
- ❌ No latency/cost tracking

**Recommendation:** Enhanced metrics:
```json
{
  "agent": "self-critic",
  "invocations": 47,
  "avg_latency_ms": 3200,
  "success_rate": 0.96,
  "avg_quality_score": 4.2,
  "total_tokens": 152000,
  "estimated_cost_usd": 1.52
}
```

#### 3. Error Handling Documentation ⭐⭐⭐⚙️⚙️
**Anthropic guidance:** "Apply appropriate guardrails for autonomous systems"

**Current state:**
- ✅ Good error handling in implementation (see analyze-conversation.sh)
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks and recovery
- ⚠️ Error patterns not explicitly documented in agent templates

**Recommendation:** Add to agent template:
```markdown
## Error Handling

Your agent should handle:
1. Missing Files: Report gracefully
2. Invalid Input: Validate and reject
3. Tool Failures: Catch and report
4. Context Limits: Detect overflow
5. Permission Denied: Clear messaging
```

### Excellent Practices Observed

#### 1. "When to Use What" Clarity ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Anthropic guidance:** "Choose workflows for predictable tasks, agents for open-ended problems"

**Our clear separation:**
- **Agents**: Explicit invocation for specialized analysis
- **Skills**: Auto-invoked for domain expertise
- **Commands**: User-triggered workflows
- **Hooks**: Event-driven automation

Each component type has clear use cases and documentation.

#### 2. Progressive Disclosure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Anthropic principle:** "Keep formats natural, eliminate overhead"

**Our {baseDir} pattern:**
```markdown
# Skills reference resources without loading upfront
For templates, see `{baseDir}/templates/agent-template.md`
Run generator: `python {baseDir}/scripts/create-agent.py`
```

Benefits:
- Reduces initial context bloat
- Loads resources only when needed
- Natural markdown syntax
- No complex escaping

#### 3. Structured Thinking Patterns ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Anthropic guidance:** "Provide sufficient tokens for model to 'think'"

**Our meta-cognitive questions:**
```markdown
## Meta-Cognitive Questions
1. What did Claude assume that should have been verified?
2. What questions should Claude have asked first?
3. What alternative approaches were not considered?
4. What edge cases were overlooked?
5. What could fail and how would it be handled?
```

This provides explicit "thinking space" before agent acts.

### Overall Compliance Score

| Principle | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Simplicity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | No unnecessary complexity |
| Transparency | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Clear workflows and reasoning |
| Tool Documentation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Excellent permission model |
| Workflow Patterns | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Right pattern for each job |
| Testing | ⭐⭐⭐⚙️⚙️ | Schema validation, needs behavior tests |
| Error Handling | ⭐⭐⭐⚙️⚙️ | Good implementation, needs docs |
| Performance Monitoring | ⭐⭐⚙️⚙️⚙️ | Basic metrics, needs enhancement |

**Overall: 4.3/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⚙️**

1. **Meta-programming**: Agents that build and improve other agents
2. **Cross-session learning**: Persistent improvement across conversations
3. **Event-driven intelligence**: Hooks for automated context management
4. **Feedback loops**: Multiple layers (manual review + automated analysis)
5. **Pattern elimination**: Proactive application of accumulated learnings

### Conclusion

This self-improvement plugin represents **reference-quality agent architecture** that:
- ✅ Strongly aligns with Anthropic's core principles
